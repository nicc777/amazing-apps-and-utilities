# amazing-apps-and-utilities

Applications, tools, utilities etc. I find interesting and useful.

I use this repo is a kind of a list of useful stuff I run into. Some I use often, while others where just really interesting. 

This is obviously personal and may include a lot of stuff more-or-less useless for most average computer users. But you are still welcome to explore of course :-)

The list is will grow over time. At some point I may create a way to document old/unmaintained/defunct apps - mainly just for historic reference.

# Online Tools (Websites/Plugins/Etc.)

_**Note**_: My preferred web browser is [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). Therefore, any plugins I mention is what I use in Firefox. Occasionally there might be an exception, and I will try to remember to point these out. On the other hand, most plugins support multiple browsers.
